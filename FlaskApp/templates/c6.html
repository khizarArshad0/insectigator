        <h2>Citrus Canker</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Dangers They Pose:</strong> Citrus canker is a bacterial
          disease that affects citrus trees, causing lesions on leaves, stems,
          and fruit. It can lead to defoliation, fruit drop, and reduced fruit
          quality, ultimately impacting citrus production.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Insecticide:</strong> Copper-based fungicides and bactericides
          are commonly used to control citrus canker, along with cultural
          practices such as pruning and sanitation.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong>Preferred Habitats:</strong> Citrus canker primarily affects
          citrus trees, including oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruits. It
          thrives in warm, humid environments and is often spread through
          wind-driven rain and contaminated equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lifecycle:</strong> Citrus canker is caused by the bacterium
          Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri. It enters citrus trees through wounds
          or natural openings and multiplies in leaf lesions, leading to the
          development of characteristic raised lesions surrounded by a
          water-soaked margin.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Season They Are Active:</strong> Citrus canker can be active
          year-round in regions with suitable climates for citrus cultivation.
          However, it may be more prevalent during periods of warm, humid
          weather when conditions are favorable for bacterial growth and spread.
