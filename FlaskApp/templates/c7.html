        <h2>Colorado Potato Beetles</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Dangers They Pose:</strong> Colorado potato beetles are
          destructive pests that feed on potato plants and related crops, such
          as tomatoes and eggplants. They cause damage by defoliating plants,
          leading to reduced yields and crop quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Insecticide:</strong> Insecticides containing ingredients such
          as pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and spinosad are commonly used to
          control Colorado potato beetle populations.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong>Preferred Habitats:</strong> Colorado potato beetles prefer to
          inhabit potato fields and gardens where their host plants are grown.
          They may also be found on other solanaceous crops and weeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lifecycle:</strong> Colorado potato beetles undergo complete
          metamorphosis, consisting of egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages. The
          lifecycle duration varies depending on temperature and food
          availability, typically ranging from 3 to 5 weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Season They Are Active:</strong> Colorado potato beetles are
          most active during the warmer months of the year, typically from late
          spring to early fall. They may overwinter as adults in soil or plant
          debris and emerge in the spring to mate and lay eggs on host plants.
