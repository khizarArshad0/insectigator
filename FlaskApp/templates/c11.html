        <h2>Fruit Flies</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Dangers They Pose:</strong> Fruit flies are nuisance pests
          that infest ripe or decaying fruits and vegetables, causing
          contamination and spoilage. They can also transmit bacteria and
          pathogens, posing a potential health risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Insecticide:</strong> Fruit fly traps, baits, and insecticides
          containing ingredients such as spinosad or pyrethrin are commonly used
          to control fruit fly populations.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong>Preferred Habitats:</strong> Fruit flies are commonly found
          near fruits, vegetables, and fermenting organic matter. They are
          attracted to sugary and decaying substances and may also inhabit
          garbage cans, drains, and compost bins.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lifecycle:</strong> Fruit flies undergo a simple life cycle,
          consisting of egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages. The lifecycle
          duration is short, typically ranging from 7 to 14 days under favorable
          conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Season They Are Active:</strong> Fruit flies are active
          year-round, but they are most prevalent during the warmer months of
          the year, especially in late summer and early fall when fruits are
          abundant and temperatures are favorable for their development.
