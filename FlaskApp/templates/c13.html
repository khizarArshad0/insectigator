        <h2>Thrips</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Dangers They Pose:</strong> Thrips are small, slender insects
          that feed on plant sap, causing damage to leaves, flowers, and fruits.
          They can transmit plant viruses and deform plant tissues, leading to
          reduced crop quality and yield.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Insecticide:</strong> Insecticides containing ingredients such
          as spinosad, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, or systemic insecticides are
          commonly used to control thrips populations.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong>Preferred Habitats:</strong> Thrips are found in a variety of
          habitats, including agricultural fields, gardens, and ornamental
          landscapes. They are often found on flowers, leaves, and buds of host
          plants, where they feed and reproduce.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lifecycle:</strong> Thrips undergo incomplete metamorphosis,
          with egg, nymph, and adult stages. The lifecycle duration varies
          depending on temperature and food availability, typically ranging from
          2 to 4 weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Season They Are Active:</strong> Thrips are active year-round
          in temperate climates but may be more abundant during the warmer
          months of the year. They can become a problem in greenhouses or indoor
          settings where conditions are favorable for their development.
